    "\n",
    "**What is Python?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. It acts as a translator, abstracting away the  details of computers and enabling us to communicate with them using a language that's easier for humans to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python emphasizes readability, making it *straightforward* to write and understand code. It supports various programming paradigms, including procedural, where we provide a sequence of instructions; object-oriented, where we create objects with data and perform actions on them; and functional programming, where code is organized around functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, Python is widely used across diverse applications, from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing. Over the years, Python has transitioned from a specialized scientific computing language to a key player in data science, machine learning, and software development, thanks to its extensive open-source libraries and its adaptability to construct sophisticated data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Python?**\n",
    "- Python is widely used, increasing the availability of resources that we, as end-users, can leverage.\n",
    "- Python is free and open-source.\n",
    "- Python is connected to many software platforms. This kind of integration with other software allows us to expand the functionality of software packages and customize solutions for specific data analysis needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, setting up a Python environment for data science is not straightforward. We need an environment that contains all the packages/libraries in a compatible way. Achieving this isn't always easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation** \n",
    "\n",
    "We can just install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This installation would have us equipped to write and run code directly from our terminal. However, this approach is rather unintuitive, especially for beginners who are just getting started with programming. That's where text editors come into play. Text editors provide a more user-friendly interface for writing and organizing code, offering features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and project management tools, making the coding process more intuitive and efficient for programmers of any level. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) as editor (aka **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment). VSCode is a very popular editor because it supports almost any language and, by downloading the right extensions, we can adapt the coding to all levels of programming. In this course we will use all the Python extensions and the Jupyter Notebook ones (*python, pylance, jupyter, jupyter cell tags, jupyter keymap, jupyter notebook renderers, jupyter slide show, python indent, python debugger, Python extended*)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the native Python installation we get a subset of basic packages, but to this environment we need to include the packages/libraries that we need for our particular tasks. Packages are extensions to the basic Python environment developed by the community. Putting it in simple words, we could say they are a collection of scripts that define a new set of functions, data type and methods that allow further manipulation of our data. Because the architecture of all these packages is highly interlinked, it is easy to run into incompatibilities when installing our packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "**UV: A Modern Python Package Manager**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we'll use [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a fast, modern Python package and project manager written in Rust. UV is designed to be a drop-in replacement for traditional tools like pip and conda, offering significantly faster installation times and better dependency resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why UV over Anaconda/Conda?**\n",
    "- **Speed**: UV is extremely fast, often 10-100x faster than pip and conda for package installations\n",
    "- **Better dependency resolution**: UV uses a modern solver that handles complex dependency trees more reliably\n",
    "- **Simpler workflow**: UV combines package management, virtual environment creation, and project management in one tool\n",
    "- **Reproducible environments**: UV automatically generates lock files ensuring everyone has the exact same package versions\n",
    "- **Less disk space**: UV efficiently manages package caches and installations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Install UV**\n",
    "\n",
    "On **macOS/Linux**, open a terminal and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On **Windows**, open PowerShell and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can install UV using:\n",
    "- **macOS with Homebrew**: `brew install uv`\n",
    "- **Windows with Chocolatey**: `choco install uv`\n",
    "- **Any platform with pip**: `pip install uv`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Clone or Download the Course Repository**\n",
    "\n",
    "Download this repository to your local machine. You'll notice it contains a `pyproject.toml` file which defines our project dependencies and a `uv.lock` file which locks specific versions for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Create and Activate the Virtual Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Navigate to the project directory\n",
    "cd path/to/DataScience_CemfiMaster\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a virtual environment and install all dependencies\n",
    "uv sync\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `uv sync` command will automatically create a virtual environment (`.venv` folder) and install all the packages specified in the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files. UV automatically activates this environment when you use `uv run` commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Verify the Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Check that Python and the required packages are correctly installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check Python version\n",
    "uv run python --version\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check that key packages are available\n",
    "uv run python -c \"import numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn; print('All packages installed successfully!')\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Set up VSCode**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure you have downloaded all the relevant Python and Jupyter extensions in VSCode\n",
    "2. Open the project folder in VSCode\n",
    "3. When you open a new Jupyter notebook, VSCode should automatically detect the UV environment\n",
    "4. If not, you can manually select the Python interpreter by:\n",
    "   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)\n",
    "   - Type \"Python: Select Interpreter\"\n",
    "   - Choose the interpreter from the UV environment (usually located in `.venv/bin/python` or `.venv/Scripts/python.exe`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key UV Commands for This Course:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `uv sync`: Install all dependencies from the lock file and create/update the virtual environment\n",
    "- `uv add package_name`: Add a new package to the project (this will update both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`)\n",
    "- `uv remove package_name`: Remove a package from the project\n",
    "- `uv run command`: Run any command in the project environment (UV automatically activates the environment)\n",
    "- `uv python install 3.11`: Install a specific Python version\n",
    "- `uv tree`: Show the dependency tree\n",
    "- `uv lock`: Update the lock file after manual changes to `pyproject.toml`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working with UV in Practice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since UV automatically manages the virtual environment activation, you don't need to manually activate/deactivate environments. Simply use `uv run` before any Python command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Instead of activating an environment and running python\n",
    "uv run python script.py\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instead of activating an environment and running jupyter\n",
    "uv run jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run any Python command\n",
    "uv run python -c \"print('Hello from UV environment!')\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding the Project Files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pyproject.toml`**: Defines project metadata and dependencies (similar to environment.yml but more modern)\n",
    "- **`uv.lock`**: Locks exact versions of all packages for reproducibility (automatically generated)\n",
    "- **`.venv/`**: Contains the virtual environment (automatically created by UV)\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup ensures that everyone in the class has exactly the same Python environment with the same package versions, making our code reproducible and avoiding the \"it works on my machine\" problem!"

    "The way in which we will interact with Python code will be through Jupyter Notebooks on VSCode.  Jupyter Notebooks, as well as the popular Jupyter Lab, are all part of the [**Jupyter Project**](https://jupyter.org/try) which revolves around the provision of tools and standards for interactive computing across different computing languages (**Ju**lia,**Pyt**hon,**R**) through computational notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks is an example of **computational notebook**. Notebooks merge code, plain language explanations, data, and visualizations into a shareable document. A notebook offers a rapid interactive platform for code typing, data exploration, visualization, and idea sharing, stemming from the belief that the most effective way to learn and program is through hands-on interaction with code. That is, we can pool together in a single file (**a notebook**) all data workflow behind our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, notebooks capture interactive session inputs and outputs along with explanatory text providing a comprehensive computational record. The notebook file, saved with the .ipynb extension, is internally JSON files, allowing for version control and easy sharing. Additionally, notebooks can be exported to various static formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks replace the traditional console-based interactive computing by introducing a web-based application that captures the entire computation process: from code development and documentation to execution and result communication. The Jupyter notebook integrates both elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A web application** (although we will use VSCode rather than the browser based extension): This browser-based editing program enables interactive authoring of computational notebooks, offering a swift environment for code prototyping, data exploration, visualization, and idea sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computational Notebook documents**: These shareable documents combine computer code, plain language explanations, data, visualizations and interactive controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook interacts with kernels, which are implementations of the Jupyter interactive computing protocol specific to different programming languages. In plain words, *kernels* are the separate process that interprets and executes our code in a given programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "From Jupyter on VSCode we can just open a new Jupyter Notebook on **File** &rarr; **New File**  &rarr; **Jupyter Notebook**. When we open a new notebook, we will find the following elements:\n",

These cells can be executed by pressing Shift-Enter, or by clicking the \"Play\" button in the toolbar or selecting \"Cell\" then \"Run\" from the menu bar. The behavior of cell execution depends on its type, with three main types: code cells, markdown cells, and raw cells. While every cell begins as a code cell, its type can be altered using a drop-down menu in the toolbar, which will be activated if you press  on the type of cell in the bottom-left corner (i.e., in the image below where it says Python.)\n",

    "\n",
    "    Allow editing and creating new code, complete with syntax highlighting and tab completion. The choice of programming language depends on the kernel, with the default kernel (IPython) executing Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Upon execution of a code cell, the resulting computation outputs are then showcased in the notebook as the cell's output. This output isn't limited to text; various forms such as matplotlib figures and HTML tables (as employed in packages like pandas for data analysis) are also supported. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Markdown: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Allow you to document the computational process in a literate manner, combining descriptive text with code using rich text. In IPython, this is achieved by using Markdown cells, where text is marked up with the Markdown language. Markdown provides a simple way to emphasize text, create lists, and structure the document using headings indicated by hash signs. Markdown headings become clickable links in the notebook and provide structure hints when exporting to other formats like PDF. When a Markdown cell is executed, the Markdown code is converted into formatted rich text, allowing for arbitrary HTML code for further formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw cells: \n",
    "\n",
    "    They allow to write output directly, meaning they are not evaluated by the kernel when runing the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A workflow in a Jupyter Notebook is run sequentially. As in a script, there is line hierarchy within cells, and there is also sequential hierarchy between cells. However, notebooks have the advantage of allowing us to edit cells separately multiple times until achieving the desired outcome, rather than rerunning separate scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on a computational problem, you can organize related ideas into cells and progress incrementally, moving forward once previous parts function correctly, which is very useful when running codes that have snippets that take long. If at anypoint we want to interrupt running a cell, we can achieve that pressing the interrupt cell. Also, we can restart the Kernel to shut down the computational process. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we run a cell, the notebook sends that process to the Kernel and prints directly the output of the execution. The execution order appears in square brackets to the left of the printed output. Notice that when we run a notebook, all cells are run in the same kernel. This means that whatever we run in a given cell will remain active unless we restart the Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, whenever we shut down a Notebook (either by restarting the Kernel or just saving and closing the notebook), all of our processes and outputs that have not been saved to disk will be erased. \n",
    "\n",
    "> My tip: while notebooks are highly useful for writing and explaining work processes, particularly for others, they may not be as practical for large research projects. Instead, I often work concurrently on a script that I run in a notebook, executing it step by step until all lines of code run smoothly. Once I have finished the code, I only save the script. "

    "3. They cannot be **keywords** (Python language reserved words).\n",
    "4. We typically use only lower case letters for variables, and reserve upper case letters for parameters or constants. \n",
    "5. Names should be self-explaining and balance out brevity and explicability. Typically, we reserve names for variables, verbs for attributes, adjectives for booleans.\n",
    "6. We can use names in any language, but in general English is preferred so that anyone could follow the code.\n",
