If you were to run your scraping procedure on the simple link ([https://www.bis.org/cbspeeches](https://www.bis.org/cbspeeches), you would only be able to scrape the first 10 speeches (the default number of speeches loaded is 10), and nothing else! \n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Solutions**:\n",
    "   - Analyzing potential API endpoints that the website might be using\n",
    "   - Using `Selenium` to automate a real browser that executes JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Best Practices**:\n",
    "   - Always check if a website uses JavaScript to load content before choosing a scraping approach\n",
    "   - Use browser dev tools (especially the Network tab) to understand how data is loaded\n",
    "   - Consider browser automation for complex sites or direct API requests for efficiency\n",
    "   - Be respectful of websites' terms of service and implement rate limiting\n",
    "\n",
